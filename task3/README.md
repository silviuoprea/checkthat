Given the text of a news article, determine whether the main claim made in the article is true, partially true, false, or other. 

### Topical Domain Classification of News Articles

Subtask 3B:  Fact-checkers require background expertise to identify the truthfulness of an article. The categorisation will help to automate the sampling process from a stream of data. Given the text of a news article, determine the topical domain of the article (English). This is a classification problem. The task is to categorise fake news articles into six topical categories like health, election, crime, climate, election, education. This task will be offered for a subset of the data of Subtask 3A.
